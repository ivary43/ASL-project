# ASL-project
This is a basic project to convert gesture into speech with the help of microprocessor and sensors. We are using flex sensors and 
accelorometer to sense the bend angle of finger and to sense the direction of motion respectively. Along with this, we are also using 
APR33A3 audio playback and LCD Display to convert the gesture into speech and text. This is a very basic module and we are trying to add a bluetooth module on top 
of it so that we can also play the speech through android phone.
