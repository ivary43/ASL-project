# ASL-project
This is a basic project to convert gesture into speech with the help of microprocessor and sensors.We are using flex sensor and 
accelorometer to sense the bend angle of finger and accelorometer to sense the direction of motion. Except this we are also using 
APR33a3 audio playback to convert the motion into speech.This is a very basic module we are trying to add a bluetooth module on top 
of it so that we can play the speech through android phone.
